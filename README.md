# ruby-tic-tac-toe
This is my fifth Ruby project made for [the Odin Project (TOP)](https://theodinproject.com) and it is my first OOP software I have ever coded. It is a faithful replica of Tic-Tac-Toe, a classical game that many of us have played it even once in our lives. By starting the game file of tic_tac_toe.rb, you can play a game of Tic-Tac-Toe with one of your friends (or with yourself if you don't have any friends). It is a complete recreation with all of the necessary game mechanics to enjoy it at it's full potential.
## How do you run it?
To run this game just like many other Ruby software, use Git or your local Linux/MacOS terminal, navigate to ../ruby-tic-tac-toe, then enter ruby tic_tac_toe.rb as mentioned above.
